### <a id="About/"></a> About
I am a journalist and researcher currently based in Los Angeles, California. Most recently, I completed a 6-month internship at the [World Resources Institute](https://www.wri.org/) (WRI), where I analyzed national climate plans and COVID-19 stimulus packages for their inclusion of adaptation actions. My reporting has appeared in [The Daily Pennsylvanian](https://www.thedp.com/staff/gianna-ferrarin), where I served as a beat reporter from 2017-2019. I am drawn to stories about gender, technology, and city planning. I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a B.A. in Urban Studies and Computer Science.
